# YOLOv7-Based-Weed-Detection-for-Precision-Farming
Develop an automated weed detection system using a CNC-based robot equipped with a YOLOv7 model for real-time classification and management of weeds in a terrace farming setup.
- You must check out the code from ITERATION #4.

**Run the Notebook**: 
Open the YOLOv7_Weed_Detection.ipynb file in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook and follow the instructions to run the model.

**Data Preparation**:
Upload your own dataset or use the provided sample images to train and test the model.
Ensure that your images are annotated using tools like LabelImg.

**Model Training & Evaluation**:
Train the YOLOv7 model using the preprocessed dataset.
Evaluate model performance using metrics such as mAP and IoU.

**Results**
The model achieved high accuracy in detecting and classifying weed objects in various scenarios. The integration with the CNC-based robot allows for real-time detection and response, reducing the need for manual intervention.

**Future Work**
Improve model accuracy by expanding the dataset and applying advanced augmentation techniques.
Enhance the robotic system to include more sensors and tools for better field management.

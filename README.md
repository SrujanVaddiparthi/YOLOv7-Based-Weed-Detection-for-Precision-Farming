# YOLOv7-Based-Weed-Detection-for-Precision-Farming
Develop an automated weed detection system using a CNC-based robot equipped with a YOLOv7 model for real-time classification and management of weeds in a terrace farming setup.
- You must check out the code from ITERATION #4.

Run the Notebook: 
Open the YOLOv7_Weed_Detection.ipynb file in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook and follow the instructions to run the model.

Data Preparation:
Upload your own dataset or use the provided sample images to train and test the model.
Ensure that your images are annotated using tools like LabelImg.

Model Training & Evaluation:
Train the YOLOv7 model using the preprocessed dataset.
Evaluate model performance using metrics such as mAP and IoU.
